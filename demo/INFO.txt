FYI, the files in these folders show examples of cropping on firefox and how screenshots are generated on chrome. There are no diff images on purpose, because i don't have access to the source of github to be able to make css/html changes.
See the ui_testing_examples folder for an extremely simply example using django.

Also, the screenshots for this file were generated via the template.py file.
